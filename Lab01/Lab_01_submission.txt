1. Questions I asked the AI ASSISTANT(deepseek):

- "Explain design patterns in simple terms"
- "What is the Rule of Three in pattern context?"
- "How to distinguish a real pattern from a proto-pattern?"
- "Show me a Factory Pattern example in JavaScript"
- "How to create a module pattern with private variables?"
- "How to apply factory pattern to a shopping cart system?"

2. How I used this information:

- Understood basic pattern concepts
- Learned to analyze code for patterns
- Understood Rule of Three criteria
- Successfully identified 3 code structures in provided code
- Wrote my own analysis using acquired knowledge
- Created my own code examples inspired by explanations but not copied

3. Code I wrote independently:

- All analysis in analysis.md (my own conclusions)
- File and folder structure
- Code comments and documentation\
- Pattern documentation
- Pattern adaptation for new scenario (shopping cart)

4. WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE:

- Now understand patterns are reusable solutions to common problems
- Learned to differentiate between patterns and proto-patterns
- Understood how closures create private variables in JavaScript
- Recognized advantages of factory functions over global objects
- Appreciated the importance of data encapsulation

5. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY CONFIRMATION:

I confirm that:
- All code was written by me manually
- AI was used only as a reference tool for concept explanations
- No IDE agents were used (Copilot, Cursor AI, etc.)
- No AI-generated code was copied
- All code examples were adapted and rewritten by me independently
- I completed the full learning process and understand each pattern used
