# Lab 3.2: Module Pattern Documentation

## My Information
Name: Nuray Koshan
Student ID: SE ENG 2 course  
Date: 31.01.2026
Course: JavaScript 

## What I Did
For this lab, I learned how to properly document design patterns using the GoF (Gang of Four) style. I focused on the Module Pattern in JavaScript.

## What I Learned
1. How design patterns are structured and documented
2. The GoF documentation format
3. How to compare different patterns
4. How old patterns relate to new JavaScript features

## Files I Created

### Documentation Files
- `module_pattern_research.md` - I researched the Module Pattern's history and how it's used
- `module_pattern_gof.md` - I wrote formal documentation in GoF style
- `pattern_comparison.md` - I compared Module Pattern with other similar patterns

### Code File
- `module_examples.js` - I wrote three different versions of the Module Pattern

## My Process

### Step 1: Research
I read Chapter 7 of the book about the Module Pattern. I looked at how it started and how it changed over time.

### Step 2: Documentation
I used the template from Chapter 3 to write proper pattern documentation. I made sure to include all the parts the book mentioned.

### Step 3: Coding
I wrote three versions:
1. Basic Module Pattern - the classic way
2. Revealing Module Pattern - cleaner version
3. ES6 Class version - modern approach

### Step 4: Analysis
I compared the Module Pattern with other patterns to understand when to use each one.

## How to Run My Code

### What You Need
- Node.js installed (version 14 or newer works)

### Steps to Run
1. Open terminal in the task2 folder
2. Type: node module_examples.js
3. You should see the examples working
