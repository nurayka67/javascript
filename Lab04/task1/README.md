# Lab 4.1 Summary

This lab analyzed legacy JavaScript code containing multiple anti-patterns described in Chapter 4 of Learning JavaScript Design Patterns (Osmani, 2023).

Five major anti-patterns were identified:
- Global namespace pollution
- Prototype modification
- String-based setTimeout usage
- Code duplication
- Tight coupling

Each anti-pattern was classified and assessed for impact on maintainability, scalability, performance, and team collaboration.
